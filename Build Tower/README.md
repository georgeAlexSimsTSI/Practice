# Build Tower

Build a pyramid-shaped tower given a position integer. A tower block is represented with "*" character
<br> e.g. a tower of 3 floors looks like this </br>
<pre>
[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
</pre>

And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

<pre>
[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]
</pre>
